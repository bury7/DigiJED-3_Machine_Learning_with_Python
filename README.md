# DigiJED-3_Machine_Learning_with_Python

This is a repository for the projects I did on the DigiJED-â€‹3 ICT Machine Learning with Python. The entire course consisted of three main labs. Labs covered topics such as data preprocessing, data classification, and data clustering.

## Overview of the Course
This course is an introduction to Machine Learning. It covers topics like supervised and unsupervised learning and introduces machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, along with approaches to evaluating machine learning models. I learned to use the scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy libraries to solve tasks in lab classes.

The course content included an introduction to machine learning and various machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. I also covered data preprocessing techniques and models like linear regression and logistic regression. I explored classifiers such as the k-nearest neighbors classifier and decision trees, and learned about metrics for classification and regression tasks. The course also included techniques for evaluating the performance of regression and classification models, as well as algorithms like k-means and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Additionally, I studied cluster validity measures and approaches to dimensionality reduction. I gained practical skills using pandas and numpy libraries for data preprocessing and the scikit-learn library for solving machine learning tasks.
